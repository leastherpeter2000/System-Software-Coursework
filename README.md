# System Software Coursework
# Code Description
According to the description given, the code looks to be for a cloud-based file storage system with user and file management features. The system offers a user interface that simulates a terminal, enabling users to execute commands and carry out various file management operations. Users can store and manage their files in the cloud using this system.

The following could be some of the system's important attributes:
1. User management: The system enables the creation, administration, and authentication of users, ensuring that only those with the proper access rights can access the data that are being saved.
2. File management: The system offers a number of file management features, including the ability to create, upload, download, delete, and share files with other users.
Files are stored in the cloud by the system, enabling users to view their files from any location with an internet connection. Emulation of a terminal: The system offers a user interface that simulates a terminal, enabling users to execute commands and handle various file management chores. Commands like ls, cd, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, rmdir, chmod, and others may fall under this category.
3. Share Files: The system may allow users to generate links to share files with non-users, such as clients or partners, without requiring them to create an account on the system.
4. As the program is yet unfinished, this document will only talk about functionalities that are already implemented.
